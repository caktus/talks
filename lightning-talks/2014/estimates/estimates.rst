Presenter Notes
---------------

* Nothing here. This is just for an example

----


Motivation
------------------------------------------------

* Accuracy of some estimates varies - Sales, Planning, Design and Technical
* Caktus is spending a lot of time on estimating projects - room for streamlining
* No current way to measure effectiveness of our estimates or apply lessons learned 

----


Project Goals
------------------------------------------------

* Explore estimate strategy (observations and solutions)
* Present findings to Caktus for discussion
* Create a new process/guidelines that enables us to increase our estimation efficiency over time

----


Our Process
------------------------------------------------

* Divide into teams -- Sales (Colin, Al); Planning (Daryl, David); Design (Michael, Wray); Technical (Karen, Mark)
* Each team started with a list of known issues and then researched possible solutions
* Each team presented research for task force discussion

----


Global Issues
------------------------------------------------

* We are using too many tools/docs for our sales, estimation and scheduling process -- use of these tools varies
* We can improve how Caktus staff are informed about the status of estimates and sales in progress
* There is room for improving how we pre-qualify potential clients before involving an estimate team
* We need to do a better job of archiving lessons learned from previous projects so we don't repeat past mistakes
* It would be great to some day be able to measure the accuracy of our estimates - at a task level
