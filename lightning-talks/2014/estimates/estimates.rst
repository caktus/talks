Overview
------------------------------------------------

* Motivation
* Project Goals
* Results

Presenter Notes
---------------

* Nothing here. This is just for an example

----


Motivation
------------------------------------------------

* Accuracy of some estimates vary - Sales, Planning, Design and Technical
* Caktus is spending a lot of time on estimating projects - room for streamlining
* There are varying definitions for some tasks (Q/A, Feedback, Testing)
* No current way to measure effectiveness of our estimates or apply lessons learned

----


Project Goals
------------------------------------------------

* Explore estimate strategy (observations and solutions)
* Present findings to Caktus for discussion
* Create a new process/guidelines that enables us to increase our estimation efficiency over time

----


Our Process
------------------------------------------------

* Divide into teams -- Sales (Colin, Al); Planning (Daryl, David); Design (Michael, Wray); Technical (Karen, Mark)
* Each team started with a list of known issues and then researched possible solutions
* Each team presented research for task force discussion

----


Global Issues
------------------------------------------------

* We are using too many tools/docs for our sales, estimation and scheduling process -- use of these tools varies
* We can improve how Caktus staff are informed about the status of estimates and sales in progress
* There is room for improving how we pre-qualify potential clients before involving an estimate team
* We need to do a better job of archiving lessons learned from previous projects so we don't repeat past mistakes
* There are new estimating methods (like planning poker) we should start trying
* It would be great to some day be able to measure the accuracy of our estimates - at a task level

----


Sales
------------------------------------------------

What were the problems

* Need to improve communication with staff on the status of sales in the pipeline
* Need a more informed way to pre-qualify clients and create ballpark estimates
* Need to improve process for comparing the accepted bid with original estimate 

----


Sales
------------------------------------------------

Recommended Solutions

* Sales staff now provide sales-pipeline reports in Monday meetings
* PMs inform what projects are starting and ending in Monday meetings
* Planning to pre-fill estimate templates with common tasks/hours for quicker turnaround of ballpark estimates
* Sales staff will now "pitch" a new project to the estimating team (business requirements, estimate expecations)
* Unresolved: Matching accepted bids to original estimates is still a manual process

----


Planning: Problems
------------------------------------------------

* Requirements Gathering vs Formal Project Planning
* No formal workflows/methods in place
* Fixed vs Hourly Contracts vs ???

Presenter Notes
---------------

* Often we end up doing a large amount of Project Planning during estimation; informally, and potentially unpaid
* What is the delineator for shoving those hours into Req Gathering vs selling a service as P1 work
* User Stories, Wireframes, IA, etc.....no prescribed formula of which method to use when
* Fixed provides client predictable Cost, Scope, Schedule, not Quality
* Hourly...pay as you go
* Is there a better way?

----


Planning: Solutions
------------------------------------------------

* Prequalification during Sales to determine need for Formal Project Planning
* Determine toolset during Sales Pitch (user stories, wireframes, I/A, all)
* Optional Scope Contract

Presenter Notes
---------------

* Client has a Grand Idea but no design or functional requirements; FPP for SOW #1
* Let the estimation team help determine the FPP needs
* Optional Scope: Time, Schedule, Quality, Scope is variable based on short dev cycles
* Optional Scope only requires 'just enough reqs' to get started, round out as you go
* Evolutionary Design of the system
* Builds trust with clients (repeat business)
* We do this already with some clients, just not Formally Named (Moz FxOSS)

----


Design: Problems
------------------------------------------------

* UI column on estimates didn't get into specifics
* Design was a blocker for development
* Vague naming of site pages to be designed
* Number of design requirements was inaccurate (at times)

----


Design: Solutions
------------------------------------------------

* Make itemized tasks: eg. Wireframing, Photoshop Mock-ups, HTML/CSS
* Itemization encourages concurrent design/dev process
* Key pages should be named: eg. "Interior page" becomes "User profile page"
* Push back to client to pay for requirements gathering service and/or
* Use a common punch list to map out needs (IA)

----


Technical: Problems
------------------------------------------------

* Dual use of "estimate" for contract and schedule
* Lack of guidance on time that an estimate should require
* UI but no Test column
* Estimation for "anyone" doing something is impossible
* No way to indicate confidence level
* Some things are not optional
* Single dev doing estimation is error-prone

----


Technical: Solutions
------------------------------------------------

* Better communication/integration of estimate team into process
* Communicate expected time for an estimate
* Better tools (smart sheet)
* Lose the UI column...no "fix" for Test?
* Allow for specifying range
* Allow for specifying confidence level
* Allow for specifying something is not optional
* Don't assign estimates to single individuals
* Better communication/integration of estimate team into process


----


Next Steps
------------------------------------------------

* We should continue to receive and review estimates concerns on a regular basis
* We need to complete our process of streamlining/reducing the number of tools we use for both estimating and scheudling projects
* When our templates/tools are updated we'll update/train all staff.

* Questions?  What do you think our next steps should be?
