            </ul>


            <aside class="notes">
              <p>  I started working in this business in 1992 at IBM, and
                moved to Caktus in 2011. Things I've worked on have almost
                always affected real customers and included having to
                diagnose and fix problems they run into.</p>

            <h3>Libyan Voter Registration</h3>
            <img height="70%" width="70%" src="Libya.jpg">
            <aside class="notes">
             <p>   I'd like to use a concrete example for this talk. I always find it
                easier to understand things from concrete examples, in addition to
                the abstract theory.</p>

                <p>One of Caktus's projects that provided a lot of experience
                    relevant to this talk was helping to build a voter registration system
                    for Libya.</p>

                <p>After the fall of Khadaffi, there was an urgent desire to bootstrap
                    a democracy. One part of that was registering citizens to vote.
                    Caktus helped develop a text-message-based voter registration system,
                    and later a web site for checking registrations and to administer the
                    system.  Over 1.5 million citizens used the system to register for two elections
                    a few years ago.</p>

                <p>Registration was opened again just this past December, and a million
                    more people had registered as of the beginning of February.</p>

            <h3>Keep it running</h3>
            <img height="70%" width="70%" src="UP_track_maintenance_vehicle.jpg">

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>If a web site or online service is worth setting up,
                    it's worth keeping it running.</p>

                <p>Mostly they just keep going and don't need much work.</p>

                <p>So if 2 months after you set up a site, it goes down,
                    you might not notice right away. Your site users might not notify
                    you - and if your site is completely down, they might not
                    be able to. And more likely, they'll
                    just go to another site.</p>

                <p>We can keep checking the site to see if it's all working -
                    but that's boring, and we're likely to get tired of it
                    and do a poor job or stop doing it completely. This is
                    the kind of thing computers are good at.
                </p>
                <p>So, let's use computers to let us know when something's wrong.
                </p>
                <p>That's all pretty obvious, of course.  As they
                    say, the devil's in the details.</p>

            <h3>Is my site down?</h3>
            <img height="80%" width="80%" src="18-01-08_08:58:29_.png">


            <aside class="notes">

                <p>Let's start with what's really the simplest - getting notified
                    when your site goes completely down. In that case, we really
                    can't rely on anything in our site code, or even on our site's
                    servers, to notify us - they're not working right.
                    So we need an external service.</p>

                <p>Like most of the tools I'm going to talk about today, there
                    are multiple options, and I make no pretense of having done
                    a comprehensive survey. I'll talk about tools that have worked
                    for us, but I make no claim that there aren't better alternatives.</p>

                <p>What I'd like you to take away today are the kinds of things
                    you should consider and watch out for when deciding what to
                    use for your own site.</p>

                <p>For getting notified when your site goes down, the most well-known
                    service is pingdom.com.  Some other choices are New Relic, and
                    the new statuscake.com.</p>

            <h3>Site down</h3>
            <img height="80%" width="80%" src="statuscake_worldchecks.png">

            <aside class="notes">

                <p>Any of these can notify you in various ways when your site goes down.
                    Both pricing and other services offered vary. Your
                    decision here is likely to depend somewhat on your choices
                    in other areas of monitoring your site.</p>

                <p>For example, New Relic can check your sites' reachability from
                    places all around the world. If for some reason your site is
                    working fine from North America, but not from Europe, they
                    can let you know. New Relic is a more expensive option, but they
                    offer a *lot* of other services. Just saying...
                </p>
                <p>And status cake does the same thing.

            <h3>Considerations for web page monitoring</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Test non-trivial pages:<ul>
                    <li>behind login</li>
                    <li>database access required</li>
                </ul> </li>
                <li>Don't get flooded with alerts</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">

                <p>
                    A home page is the obvious page to point a "site down" checker at, but it's
                    often your most trivial page. It might work fine even when things are so broken
                    no other pages work. Or maybe people can't log in, or only the pages behind
                    logins are broken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might want to set up a special page just for the site monitor to check.
                    It might do some database access or whatever would give you confidence that
                    all the important parts of your site are healthy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don't want repeated notices every time the service sees a failure to load
                    a page. I know someone with a site that has a small bug that only shows up for
                    one hour a year - that hours when daylight saving time causes the same hour to
                    happen twice. And for every second of that hour, he gets an alert that his site
                    is broken. Then it stops for another year... so he puts off fixing it.... and then
                    another year has gone by and it happens again :-)

            <aside class="notes">
        <p>        Tell story of site going down a couple of weeks ago, project lead getting notified
                and working with sys admin on Slack to diagnose. Turned out to be the ISP having
                blackholed our IP address after a DOS attack.</p>

               <p> Luckily, the web site is not the most important part of the Libya project and the
                text messages continued being processed without interruption.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
                <p>What if your site is responding, but abnormally slowly? You'd like
                    to know that, but a simple check that it's reachable won't tell you.
                    Most of the same services that can let you know your site is down,
                    can also tell you if it's working poorly. Statuscake can let you
                    know that. New Relic can not only let you know that, but show you
                    exactly where in your request processing the slowdown is.</p>

            <h3>Memory, CPU, Disk</h3>
            <img height="80%" width="80%" src="statuscake_hw_monitoring.png">

            <aside class="notes">
                Another thing to think about is whether you can get advance notice
                that trouble is coming. It's a good idea to set up warnings for
                things like disk space and CPU usage going over some threshold.
                Then you can take action - enlarge your disk, add servers, etc -
                before it starts causing problems for your users.

                New Relic and Status Cake can both do this. Here's a screenshot
                from Status Cake.

            <aside class="notes">
                And then there's the infamous problem of having your domain expire
                without noticing.  Microsoft let passport.com expire in 1999, causing
                a total outage for Hotmail. You don't want to make the news for something like that.

                You guessed it, there are tools to warn you about  that.

            <h3>Gather your logs</h3>
            <img height="80%" width="90%" src="Logs-Port-of-Burnie-20160208-004.jpg">
            <aside class="notes">
               <p> When you're trying to figure out a problem, sooner or later you'll end up
                looking at logs.</p>

                <p>By default, every application that helps keep your site or service running
                will put its log messages somewhere different, and you'll have to login to
                every system individually to look at them. This is a nuisance even for a
                small, single-server site, and almost unusable as your site grows beyond that.</p>

               <p> You might also not want your developers even to be able to log into your
                production servers, depending on your service's security requirements.</p>

                <p>The solution is to gather your logs in a central place.</p>

               <p> You can actually do this without any additional software. Unix logging systems
                have had the capability for decades to forward messages to other servers and
                to accept incoming ones and store them in a single place, or route them based
                on various criteria.</p>

              <p>  In these days of the cloud, there are lots of online servers where you can
                forward your log messages, and they'll store them, make them easily searchable,
                allow setting up patterns that'll trigger notifications. Some can even analyze
                the messages and extract data about your site.</p>

            <p>    We've used Papertrail, a paid cloud service with a free tier if you don't have
                a large volume of log messages. ELK can also do this, which I'll talk about later.</p>

                <li>Security: if the logs are accessible elsewhere, you might not even need to
                let your developers have login access to the servers</li>
                <li>There are different kinds of logs, so consider treating them individually.
                    Some might warrant long storage, others fairly short, for example.</li>

            <img width="80%" height="80%" src="dog-647528_1280.jpg">

            <aside class="notes">
                In the Sherlock Holmes story "Silver Blaze", Holmes is the only one who notices what *didn't* happen but
                should have -- the dog didn't bark in the nighttime.
<br>
                The lesson for us is that we tend not to notice when things that are supposed to happen,
                don't.  Like our automated backups. Or sending out monthly invoices. Often important stuff.
<br>
                This is a really good thing to assign a computer to do for us.
<br>
                There are numerous online services that will help you with this.  The one I've used
                is healthchecks.io, which is free for everything I've needed to do with it.
<br>
                You tell it you want to monitor some periodic event, and how often it's supposed to happen.
                It assigns a unique URL, and you arrange to ping that URL when the event completes successfully.
                For example, you might add "&amp;&amp; wget &lt;URL&gt;" to a cron command.
<br>
                If healthchecks.io *doesn't* hear from your task when it should, it notifies you.

                So far we've been talking about things that can affect our entire site
                or service, and how to get advance notice of upcoming problems, and
                urgent notice when problems actually occur.  We've gone beyond just
                seeing if the home page works, to checking the site from around the
                world, watching things like disk space, cpu, and memory, and even
                getting reminded when a domain or certificate needs to be renewed.

            <h3>Errors on your site</h3>
            <img height="70%" width="70%" src="Http_error_500.jpg">

            <aside class="notes">

                <p>But there are also problems that only affect some of your users, or
                only when users do certain things.  Again, some users might let you
                know, but most won't. You can't rely on it.</p>

             <p>   At Caktus, we use the Django framework to build our web sites using
                Python. Django has a neat feature where it can email the site admins
                whenever an uncaught exception happens during request processing.
                That won't tell you if a user is getting shown a wrong answer, but
                it will let you know if a user is getting an error page. The email
                message includes the exception, the stack trace, and details of the
                request and the site settings.</p>

               <p> This is great during testing, and when you're just getting your site
                going. It not only notifies you, it gathers a lot of information that
                is often all you need to figure out exactly what happened.
</p>
                <p>If you're using Django, I recommend enabling this during your site
                development. When your testers hit problems, it'll gather more information
                than your tester could have gotten for you at the time.</p>

        <p>        I imagine there are ways to do something similar when errors occur
                if you're not using Django.</p>

                <p>Once your site starts getting any significant traffic, though, you should
                turn this off and replace it with something better.</p>

            <h3>A flood of error emails</h3>
            <img width="70%" height="70%" src="The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa.jpg">

            <aside class="notes">


                Imagine this scenario.
                Your site is getting hundreds or thousands of requests per hour. That's
                per *hour*, not minute or second; it's not really all that much traffic.

                Overnight, something happens that starts making every request fail. Maybe
                your database goes down, or somebody changes the password on the search
                backend - whatever.

                And every time a request fails, the site send you
                another email message.
                Picture your inbox when you come in the next morning. It won't be pretty -
                thousands or tens of thousands of these error messages.

                And as you try
                to fix the problem, they'll keep pouring in.

                And after you fix the problem,
                more will keep coming, and you'll notice they are dated hours ago, and
                that the flood of email was so great that a lot of it is backed up somewhere
                in the internet and is going to keep getting delivered for hours and hours
                more.

                Your SMTP provider (handling the outgoing mail from your servers) might
                not be too happy with you either.

                As you might gather, I've been there.

                And when it happens, I kick myself because I should have set up Sentry
                earlier.

            <h3>Sentry</h3>
            <img height="80%" src="18-01-08_09:31:46_.png">
            <aside class="notes">

               <p> Sentry is an open source service to sit between your site's error reports
                and you. You can subscribe to a hosted service, or set up your own server.
                Then you configure your site to notify Sentry about problems instead of
                sending emails to you.</p>

              <p>  Sentry is smart. It not only gathers *more* information about the problem
                than Django includes in its emails, it also recognizes when the same problem
                happens over and over, and only notifies you *once*.</p>

                <p>It keeps track, of course. You can go to the Sentry web interface for
                that problem and see how many times people have hit that problem, how
                long it's been happening, and whether it's getting more frequent.
                Then you can drill down into one of the occurrences to see the exception,
                the stack trace, the request data, plus local variables and function
                arguments.</p>

               <p> Once you think you've fixed a problem, you can mark it _resolved_ in
                Sentry. Once you do that, if it ever happens again, Sentry will send
                you a fresh notice, and also let you know this problem has happened
                before and so this is a possible reggresion.</p>

            <h3>New Relic</h3>
            <img src="newrelic.png">
            <aside class="notes">

                <p>Now I'm going to say a little more about New Relic, which I've already
                mentioned. New Relic is the gold standard of monitoring tools. A surprising
                number of well-known sites use it, because it's worth it - it's expensive,
                but it does almost everything I've mentioned here, and does it as well
                or better than any other tool I know of.</p>

                <p>It can check that your site is up from places around the world.</p>

              <p>  It can notify you when there's a performance or resource problem.</p>

              <p>  It's so well integrated into your application that if, for example, a
                request is slow, New Relic can show you which part of the code processing
                that request is taking most of the time. It's incredibly helpful to
                know whether a query is slow, or you're doing a query more times than
                you need to, or maybe rendering some templates is taking a long time,
                or some 3rd-party service is responding slowly.</p>

              <p>  There's a free tier that provides enough of the New Relic service to
                get a feel for it.</p>

            <h3>ELK: ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana</h3>
            <img src="kibana.png">
            <aside class="notes">

               <p> I'm going to finish up by talking about another set of open source tools
                that we've been trying out lately that shows some real promise. It's
                the combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, or more briefly,
                "ELK".</p>
<p>
                These tools have been around for a while, but putting them together was
                left as an exercise. Now the developers are providing a container with
                the whole set configured to work together.</p>

           <p>     Logstash stores information gathered from your servers, both log messages
                and statistics.</p>

         <p>       Then Kibana provides a very flexible front-end to analyze and visualize
                all that data, using Elasticsearch to efficiently process the data.</p>

             <p>   There are agents to install on your servers that forward log messages,
                or gather metrics.</p>
<p>
                So ELK can replace several other services that run on your serve</p>rs.

            <aside class="notes">
                Like papertrail, ELK can collect your logs, search them, etc.
