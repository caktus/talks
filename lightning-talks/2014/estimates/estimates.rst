Presenter Notes
---------------

* Nothing here. This is just for an example

----


Motivation
------------------------------------------------

* Accuracy of some estimates vary - Sales, Planning, Design and Technical
* Caktus is spending a lot of time on estimating projects - room for streamlining
* Not everyone defines some of our estimating tasks the same (Q/A, Feedback, Testing)
* No current way to measure effectiveness of our estimates or apply lessons learned 

----


Project Goals
------------------------------------------------

* Explore estimate strategy (observations and solutions)
* Present findings to Caktus for discussion
* Create a new process/guidelines that enables us to increase our estimation efficiency over time

----


Our Process
------------------------------------------------

* Divide into teams -- Sales (Colin, Al); Planning (Daryl, David); Design (Michael, Wray); Technical (Karen, Mark)
* Each team started with a list of known issues and then researched possible solutions
* Each team presented research for task force discussion

----


Global Issues
------------------------------------------------

* We are using too many tools/docs for our sales, estimation and scheduling process -- use of these tools varies
* We can improve how Caktus staff are informed about the status of estimates and sales in progress
* There is room for improving how we pre-qualify potential clients before involving an estimate team
* We need to do a better job of archiving lessons learned from previous projects so we don't repeat past mistakes
* It would be great to some day be able to measure the accuracy of our estimates - at a task level

Sales
------------------------------------------------

TODO: What were the problems

* Staff not informed about status of sales in the pipeline

Technical: Problems
------------------------------------------------

* Dual use of "estimate" for contract and schedule
* Lack of guidance on time that an estimate should require
* UI but no Test column
* Estimation for "anyone" doing something is impossible
* No way to indicate confidence level
* Some things are not optional
* Single dev doing estimation is error-prone

----


Technical: Solutions
------------------------------------------------

* Better communication/integration of estimate team into process
* Communicate expected time for an estimate
* Better tools (smart sheet)
* Lose the UI column...no "fix" for Test?
* Allow for specifying range
* Allow for specifying confidence level
* Allow for specifying something is not optional
* Don't assign estimates to single individuals
* Better communication/integration of estimate team into process
