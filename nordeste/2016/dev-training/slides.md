## Developer Fitness
### Mark Lavin

Notes:
I'm here today to talk about developer training. That is how do we as developers get better at
building applications and libraries. That after all, is why many people go to conferences. To learn
and get better, find new ways of doing things.

As much as I might want to at times I can't separate the person I am at work from the person I am
outside of work. One constantly impacts the other. Who I am as a person shapes my thoughts and approach
to Python. If you've spent any amount of time with me you'd know that I'm an avid runner and triathlete.
I actually started working in Python and running about the same time so for me they are forever linked.
I've had my share of successes and failures in both Python and sport since. So I'm here to help you
build your personal training plan on how to become the developer you wish to become.

## I â™¥ running

Notes:
One of the things I love about running is that I feel like I'm totally free and in control. I can
make my body go faster or slower. I can push and make it hard or take it easy. I know how to get
better. There is sport science dedicated to how the human body adapts to training stress. How much
to apply when. Yet still each person has to learn their own personal limits and training can be as
much art as science.

And so it's the same with becoming a better programmer. There are tons of books and resources on
programming but there is no one perfect way to become a better programmer. We each must learn our
own way but that doesn't mean we can't learn from each other's experiences.

Notes:
The process of getting better at anything to me begins with having a goal in mind. This is a definition
about what better means. When I set out with a new goal I like to write it down.
I talk about that goal with the people closest to me. Not just the goal but what I need to do to get
to that goal. How long I think it will take and how realistic it is. Goals need to be measurable
and time-boxed never open ended. I'm going to run a set time at a set race.

I define the success of my goals in terms of things I can control. I don't set goals about how I'll
place in a race but rather about how I personally will finish. This allows me to measure along the
way whether or not I'm getting closer to my goal. When developing new skills you need the same
approach. Your goal shouldn't be on being better than anyone other than being better than the current
version of yourself.

## A Goal Without a Plan Is Just a Wish

Notes:
With a specific and measurable goal in mind you need to build a plan around what you are going to
do to meet that goal. For instance, you may want to learn a new library or framework or even a new
programming language. Start with the why: why are you going to learn it? Is there something in
particular that you want to get out of it? Use this framework for an upcoming project? Get a new
job? Just for fun? They why shapes how you need to measure your progress, how long it will take, etc.

Notes:
And don't forget the why along the way. When things aren't going well or when you are near the end
you should be reflecting back on why you started this in first place. If you started to learn something
for fun and it's no longer fun, then you either need to set a new goal or stop. At the same time
if you started learning something just for fun and now you start thinking that maybe you'd like to
do this for a job, you need to set a new goal and build a new plan.

## Train the Way You Need to Train

Notes:
When it comes to amateur sports, most people don't train the way they need to train. They train the
way they want to train. They do what they are already comfortable doing and they just do it more.
This works up to a point but for continued growth you must move outside of your comfort zone.
I feel that many developers fall into this same trap. You can't get better without first admitting
that you have a weakness. Then you build a plan around addressing weaknesses which are holding you
back from reaching your goal. If you aren't getting the opportunities at your current job or role,
then are you willing to make time to do them?

Notes:
Aspects of fitness. Running a marathon isn't easy but it is simple.
Start moving and don't quit until you've gone 26.2 miles
(42.2 km). The challenges you'll face during that time are fairly predictable. You'll need aerobic
endurance and fitness. You'll have to deal with heat or wind or rain or hills.

Programming on the other hand is complicated. Software development is a knowledge acquisition activity.
You generally don't know everything you'll need to know to complete it when you are starting. You have
to learn and adapt as you go. So what are some areas that we as developers might need to address to get better
at doing this?

## Base

Notes:
Base/Foundataion

For developers, endurance is about continually learning base and core skills. Language idioms and
design patterns. Data modelling or translating human requirements into code. These come with practice and experience.
They can be excellerated by learning from other's experiences/mistakes before making them yourself.

Some activities include:

- Learn a new framework/tool
- Update a major dependency
- Attend a conference or user group
- Follow a tech blog/news aggregator

## Flexibility

Notes:
Flexibility

Developers need to be flexible though not in the same way as an athelete does. Developers need to be
creative. Creative enough to solve problems that have never been solved before. Creative to find ways
to automate boring things. This can sometimes mean abandoning previous notions of "best practice".

Some activities include:

- Start a new project
- Reinvent a wheel
- Prototype

## Maintenance

Notes:
Maintenance

It does not take a skilled programmer to build something that works but it does take one to make something
that lasts. Maintaining a project for years is very different challenge than writing something from
scratch. But if you've maintained something, then when you start a new project you have a new perspective
and a new set of concerns for what you know will become a challenge in the future.

Some activities include:

- Add test coverage to an existing project
- Find and Delete dead code
- Refactor a project
- Port to a new framework/library

## Humility

Notes:
For me programming is often an exercise in being wrong. I'm wrong about what the user's want or what
they should do or will do. I'm wrong about what will be the fastest way to do something. The sooner
you can learn to admit that you are wrong the sooner you can start making things better. Becoming
a stronger developer means craving feedback. Could this be better?

Some activities include:

- Take part in a code review
- Contribute to an open source project

## Empathy

Notes:
Programming is not a solidary activity to me. To build something real and something meaningful you
need other people. If nothing else you need other people to use what you are building so you need
empathy for your users.
But you also need empathy for your fellow developers. You have to think about them trying to read
and follow what you've done. Or people who might want to use or even contribute to your project.

- Write documentation
- Teach someone else
- Pair program
- Maintain an open source project

## Trust the Process

Notes:
When you go to run a marathon you typically only run 20 miles as your longest run. The first time
you'll do that it will probably be terrible. It was for me. That means on race day, for most people,
they will run 10 km more than they've ever run on race day. This is me from the first time I ran a
sub-1:30 half marathon. It was a March race and I had some set backs in the winter and didn't put the
volume I wanted. Race week I decided to run 5 miles - one mile to warm up, 3 miles at race pace,
and a mile to cool down. I thought I was going to die. Those 3 miles seems to last forever. I thought
there was no way I could run 10 more on race day at that pace. It wrecked my confidence. But on race
day I stuck to my plan. I kept waiting for my pace to fade and it never did. My body knew what to do.

Once you've identified where you need to improve and you've built a plan to do it then just stay with
it. Check and test your progress along the way. Re-evaluate your plan and adjust. Your goals are
about doing something you've never done before so don't worry about never having done it. Julia and
I had no idea how to write a book. But we started sketching out chapters and drawing up a schedule of
when we thought we could have it done. When we broke it down it was a few hours every other night
and a big day on the weekend. It's amazing what you can do if you keep moving forward and you just
trust the process.

## Listen to Your Body

Notes:
Running is notorious for causing injuries. You muscles rebound much faster than your joints and
ligaments so it's easy to push too hard too soon and get hurt. To address this there is a common
saying which is "listen to your body when it whispers and you'll never have to hear it scream."

For developers, burnout is real and
particularly when it comes to open source. Set reasonable goals and make sure you factor in
time for the rest of your life. When life outside of work, etc is high then that probably isn't a
great time to start a new project, talk at a conference, join a new Meetup group, or learn a language.
Those things will be there when you have the time so aim to do less than you think you can handle.

## I Did the Training, I Belong

Notes:
Along your journey you will have moments of doubt. Everyone one has them. I'm not new to racing nor
to speaking at conferences but at every starting line and before I show my first slide I'm always
terribly nervous. I calm my fears by thinking back to the work I've put in: those quiet mornings
when it was just me and the road putting in the miles. The thousand times I read these slides on
plane, tweaking and improving. Focus on constantly getting better. No one can take away the work
you are putting in.
