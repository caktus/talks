5Essentials Schools Surveys
===========================

Started at UChicago; 5Essentials team designs and conducts surveys to assess:

* Effective leaders
* Collaborative teachers 
* Involved families
* Supportive environment 
* Ambitious instruction

Schools with strong scores on at least 3 of these are 10 times more likely to improve math and reading.

About the Project
=================

**5Essentials Survey Admin Module (SAM)**

- April 2011: Hired by UChicago / 5Essentials
- February 2012: First survey for Chicago Public Schools (~400,000 students)
- February 2013: Illinois state-wide Survey (2 million students, teachers, and parents)

Presenter Notes
---------------

- CPS is 3rd largest in US, over 400,000 students

Fast or Scalable?
=================

- Fast: the code runs quickly
- Scalable: runs acceptably (or better) for lots of people

----

Why this talk?
==============

Scaling read-heavy web apps is easy:

- Add caching, add web servers
- Rinse, repeat

Taking a survey means saving lots of data really fast.

----

Architecture
============

- Python 2.7
- Django 1.5
- Python 2.7
- PostgreSQL 9.1
- Nginx
- Gunicorn
- Celery
- Redis
- Memcached
- RabbitMQ
- S3 for static media

----

Step 1: django-debug-toolbar
============================

Install it:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install django-debug-toolbar

And add it to your local development settings file:

.. code-block:: python

    INTERNAL_IPS = ('127.0.0.1',)
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.append('debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware')
    INSTALLED_APPS.append('debug_toolbar')

Presenter Notes
---------------
- If you haven't used it, you really need to now, and it's really easy to install
- Need to eliminate unnecessary SQL queries on high-traffic pages
- Don't blindly optimize everything, focus on pages that'll give you the most gain

----

Step 1: django-debug-toolbar
============================

Common patterns include:

- **select_related:** When iterating through a list of model objects, use ``select_related()`` with specific field names to retrieve everything you need in one query. Make sure the combined query isn't more expensive.
- **request-local caching:** Find identical queries that you make multiple times during the same request, and cache their output on the request or other relevant Python object (not via ``django.core.cache``)

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Remember, we want to limit the total amount of stuff that the DB server has to do
- Ultimately we only care about writes, but if the database server is doing lots of unnecessary reads, that'll slow it down
- Some but not all of this can be taken care of with a DB slave

----

Step 2: Automate some load
==========================

Before going any further, you need an easy way to generate load. JMeter's a good tool for that; here there are a few tips:

- **Recording:** If you have a long or complicated process to test, use JMeter's proxy server to record your actions in a web browser
- **Sane defaults:** Set up sane defaults using HTTP Request Defaults, so you can easily switch servers.
- **CSRF Token:** Use JMeter's HTTP Cookie Manager to save and retrieve the token
- **Test script:** Save your test script along side your other infrastructure files in version control.

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Simple tasks are easy enough to script manually, but it's a lot easier to script longer tasks (like filling out an entire survey) by recording.  JMeter has great tools for this; learn to use & love them.
- You'll want to test different server environments (including your local machine), so practice DRY test script writing and take the time to setup good default for HTTP requests.
- The CSRF token can be a bit hair to keep track of at first, but once you have it set up it's easy to maintain.
- Save your test scripts in version control and continue to refine them.  They'll come in handy over and over again..  Really.

Step 3: pgfouine
================

Next, pgfouine can help you detect high-frequency, redundant queries *across* multiple requests.

On Debian or Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: sh

    apt-get install pgfouine

Edit ``postgresql.conf``:

.. code-block:: python

    log_min_duration_statement = 0 # log all statements with durations
    log_line_prefix = '%t [%p]: [%l-1] ' # pgfouine-specific log prefix
    lc_messages = 'C' # character encoding pgfouine can understand

After generating some load, run ``pgfouine`` on your log file:

.. code-block:: sh

    pgfouine -file /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log -logtype stderr > report.html

Step 4: Let's play cache
========================

We have the data, let's cache strategically.  Options:

- Django's per-site or per-view caches **<- this talk is not about these; you should be using them (if you can) anyways**
- Django's **low-level cache API**
- **johnny-cache** - Great if you need to cache everything
- **django-cache-machine** - Great if you need to cache specific things in specific ways
- There are many others...

Presenter Notes
---------------

- Based on all the output from pgfouine, you should have a good sense of what queries will give you the most gain for caching.
- Find select statements that you don't expect to change often (if at all), and cache them
- Find a strategy that works for you; we tried to make johnny-cache work, but it was too much black magic for us
- We found django-cache-machine worked better; it allowed us to cache exactly what we want when we wanted in predictable ways

----

django-cache-machine
====================

Install it:

.. code-block:: python

pip install django-cache-machine

Activate it:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # ...
        cached = caching.base.CachingManager()

Presenter Notes
---------------
- You can overwride the default manager or create a new one
- We chose the latter to make it explicit that you were caching
- This worked better for us, b/c there's nothing worse that debugging stale cache issues

----

django-cache-machine
====================

Some things to be aware of:

- django-cache-machine does not cache empty querysets by default.  If you have a lot these, you might want to turn this on:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    CACHE_EMPTY_QUERYSETS = True

- ``count()`` cannot easily be invalidated, so these queries time out instead.  Set the timeout to something that makes sense for you:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    CACHE_COUNT_TIMEOUT = 300

----

Multiple databases
==================


Presenter Notes
---------------
- Streaming replication in PostgreSQL 9.1 is incredibly easy to set up.
- We needed to save the master database for writes, so we moved all the reads
