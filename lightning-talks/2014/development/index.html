                    What do I mean by "Development Methodology"?
                    I mean the process by which we create applications.
                    Not specifically about the tools. The tools are meant to empower the
                    process not dictate the process.

                    New staff/contractors. No formal training on this. It's been
                    folklore. Whispers passed on from Tobias, Colin, Mark, and Karen.

                    This is also for the non-technical staff to understand our
                    workflow and how our thought process is motivated when discussing
                    projects and timelines. At times we talk about it like everyone
                    already knows it but

                <h2>Agile Inspired</h2>
                <aside class="notes">
                    We/I frequently talk about our process as agile inspired or practical agile.
                    To me this means incorporating the agile manifesto in a way that
                    fits the task at hand depending on team size/experience, project
                    stability and project timeline. It's not Scrum or Kanban or
                    Extreme Programming. It's whatever works for the client and the
                    team that has to deliver the project. 
                    But what is "Agile"? It seems like an abstract buzzword like webscale.

                    It's short and to the point.

                    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
                    Working software over comprehensive documentation
                    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
                    Responding to change over following a plan

                    There is also a 12 principles which spell this out even more.
                    If you've never read it you should.

                    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

                    The process adapts to the team and client we have. Things that work
                    well for large long term projects like Libya might not work
                    for projects we turn around in 3 weeks like Mobile Partners.

                    Project leads and project managers shape how they want the project to run.

                    - Working software over comprehensive documentation

                    Unit tests document how the code works. Not how it should work
                    or might work. How it actually works at any point in time.

                    There will always be questions about how it should work. There
                    should never be questions about how it does.

                    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

                    This is hard for us to achieve completely because you really
                    need trust and buy-in from both sides. We talked more about
                    this during the estimation task force meetings, selling a more
                    agile process. Sadly it's not an easy sell to say "we don't know
                    exactly what will be made but we will always agree that it is
                    what was wanted."

                    - Responding to change over following a plan

                    It's more important to get the customer what they want/need
                    than to give them what was agreed to at times. Everything must
                    be flexible. Achieving this is difficult and there are trade offs.
                    We'll explore that next.

                    We have a few copies of this book around (small pocket version). Again
                    this isn't something we are strict about but there are some ideas which
                    drive out development process.

                    In particular the ideas of code review, rigorous unittesting, and simple/clean code
                    (i.e. waiting on features until they are needed, no early optimizations).

                <aside class="notes">
                    In the book there is a great description of timeboxing as of tuning a development
                    project with a set of knobs: Resources/Cost, Time/Schedule, Scope, and Quality

                    We don't like to cut quality (and it can only be cut so much before it stops working).
                    So if you want to add scope you have to either add time or resources. Adding
                    resources has a diminishing return. The classic example being that 9 women
                    can't make a baby in 1 month.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Tobias talked about using Open Source methodologies though it's vague what
                    exactly that means. So I thought about open source projects and philosophies
                    that shape how we think about development. I came up with three that
                    I think fit the best and again share a lot in common with the agile
                    manifesto.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Unix philosophy emphasizes building short, simple, clear, modular,
                    and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by
                    developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors
                    composability as opposed to monolithic design.

                    Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
                    Write programs to work together.

                    do and use those to drive your future work.
